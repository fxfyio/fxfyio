I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.

Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.

I've watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.

All those ... 

moments will be lost in time, 

like tears...

in rain.

Time to die.

我见过你们人类绝对无法置信的事物，

我目睹了战船在猎户星座的端沿起火燃烧，

我看着C射线在唐怀瑟之门附近的黑暗中闪耀，

所有这些时刻，

终将随时间消逝，

一如眼泪消失在雨中。
